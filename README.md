This project is a weather application that retrieves and displays weather data for a specified city using JavaScript and the WeatherAPI. The application fetches the current weather and a 3-day forecast, displaying key information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

Key Features:
Data Retrieval: The application uses the WeatherAPI to fetch weather data for a city, which is then processed and displayed.
Current Weather Display: It shows the current date, city name, temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed, and direction.
3-Day Forecast: The app also displays the weather forecast for the next two days, including maximum and minimum temperatures, weather icons, and descriptions.
City Search: Users can search for different cities using a search bar. As the user types, the application fetches and updates the weather data for the entered city.
Dynamic Updates: The weather information is dynamically updated in real-time based on the user's input.
